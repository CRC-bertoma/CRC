# ☁️ Azure Visitors Counter (Work In Progress) 🚧

This project serves as part of my journey towards becoming a proficient cloud engineer and is based on the guidelines of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/), a framework designed by Forrest Brazeal to help individuals acquire practical cloud skills.

It's a scalable visitor counter for my personal website, leveraging Microsoft Azure's serverless functions and Cosmos DB. The infrastructure is largely managed using Terraform and integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). The project incorporates end-to-end testing using Cypress.
